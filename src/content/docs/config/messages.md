description: All of the messages within the messages.yml file for Plex
---

Almost all the messages inside of Plex are fully customizable. This page will document how to change messages in the
```messages.yml``` file inside the Plex folder.

## Default file

The default `messages.yml` file is below.

```yaml title="/plugins/Plex/messages.yml"
# Plex Messages File
# This file uses the MiniMessage system.
# Documentation available at https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/format.html

# Messages in here will be placed in for certain commands, actions, etc.
# Warning: not all commands have customizable messages

# Variables {number} - these are code-defined replacements for things that should be inserted into messages. (e.g. names, statuses, numbers)
# If any of these variables are supposed to be used within a message, some documentation is provided to give more context to what the variables indicate.
# If you are wishing to change these messages it's recommended you use the same amount of variables as stated in the documentation, however it's not required.

## MiniMessage

The `messages.yml` file uses MiniMessage for coloring messages. For example, writing `<aqua>`, will color the text aqua.
This is not like HTML, and you should not close the tag (`</aqua>`). There are some special functions as well, such as
`<rainbow>`. The default color will be gray. For a complete guide on using MiniMessage,
visit: [https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html).

## Troubleshooting

If you receive `No message.` when executing a command, it is likely you need to regenerate your `messages.yml` file. The
default configuration file is also available
on [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlexDevelopment/Plex/master/src/main/resources/messages.yml). As of Plex
0.6 (Beta 6), your `messages.yml` file should automatically update with new entries.
