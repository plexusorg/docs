## Why Plex?

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Performance Oriented" icon="rocket">
        Plex was designed with performance in mind. Plex supports SQLite or MariaDB out of the box. Plex also uses Redis
        for punishments instead of traditional YAML / JSON files.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Fully Customizable" icon="setting">
        Plex is designed to be customizable to fit your server's needs. Almost all messages within the plugin can be
        easily changed.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Permissions" icon="list-format">
        Plex allows you to use integrate with a permission system and "fake op" players. This allows server owners to
        have much more control over what is and isn't allowed. Any Vault-compatible permission plugin will integrate
        with Plex and can be used instead of ranks.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Modular" icon="cloud-download">
        Plex features a fully modular system. You can add or remove modules based on how your server is configured. If
        you're using permissions, you likely won't need our command blocker, but you will if you use ranks.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Converters" icon="random">
        We have written tools to convert your existing data from TotalFreedomMod to Plex. This will make your transition
        even easier so you won't have to start fresh.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Quality Control" icon="sun">
        Each release is tested to find bugs before you have to encounter them on your server. Plex's codebase was
        designed for rapid progress and won't unexpectedly break.
