## Why Plex?

<CardGrid>
    <Card title="Performance Oriented" icon="rocket">
        Plex was designed with performance in mind. Plex supports SQLite or MariaDB out of the box. Plex also supports
        using Redis for punishments instead of traditional YAML / JSON files.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Fully Customizable" icon="setting">
        Plex is designed to be customizable to fit your server's needs. You can customize almost all of the messages and
        the chat format. It's also easy to create as many custom worlds as you desire.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Permissions" icon="list-format">
        Plex allows you to use integrate with a permission system and "fake op" players. This allows server owners to
        have much more control over what is and isn't allowed. Any Vault-compatible permission plugin will integrate
        with Plex.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Modular" icon="cloud-download">
        Plex features a fully modular plugin system. You can add or remove modules based on your server needs. We have
        many additions such as adding a modern HTTPD server using modules.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Converters" icon="random">
        We have written tools to convert your existing data from TotalFreedomMod to Plex. This will make your transition
        even easier so you won't have to start fresh.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Quality Control" icon="sun">
        Every release undergoes rigorous testing to catch bugs before they reach your server. Plex's codebase is built
        for stability and rapid development, ensuring consistent performance without unexpected breaks.
