description: An overview of the FalseOp module for Plex
---

The FalseOp module uses ProtocolLib to trick clients into thinking they have true operator privileges. This is useful as
Plex uses permissions rather than granting true operator privileges to users. This module has no additional
configuration, commands, or permissions.

As of Plex version 1.5, this module is no longer supported.
