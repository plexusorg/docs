description: An overview of the BukkitTelnet module for Plex
---

The BukkitTelnet is a very simple module. The only purpose of the module is to allow authorized users to automatically
log in to telnet without needing to enter the password. You need to add the `plex.telnet.autoconnect` to the groups you
want to allow automatic logins to BukkitTelnet.
