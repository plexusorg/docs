Plex's modular architecture allows server owners to customize their experience by adding optional features. These modules integrate seamlessly with the core plugin while maintaining stability and performance.

## How Modules Work
You can download modules from the CI Server. Simply place the downloaded module files in the `/plugins/Plex/modules/`
directory. You can then run `/plex modules reload` in-game to load the new module in.

Once a module has been installed, you can update it to the latest build by running `/plex modules update`.
