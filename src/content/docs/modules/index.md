description: An introductory to all of the modules and versions available for Plex
---

Plex has optional modules to add additional features to your server experience. Modules are placed in the
`/plugins/Plex/modules` folder. They extend off of Plex and can add or change functionality. They are designed for
server owners who may want a specific feature that's not built in to Plex.

Below is a list of official and supported modules
