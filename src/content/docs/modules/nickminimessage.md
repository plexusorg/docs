The NickMiniMessage module allows players to set their nickname in Essentials using MiniMessage. This module requires
EssentialsX to be on the server.

can use MiniMessage formatting.

Examples:
- Rainbow nickname: `/nickmm <rainbow>MyNickname`
- One color: `/nickmm <red>MyNickname`
- Multiple colors: `/nickmm <red>My<blue>Nickname`
