import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Plex is built using **Gradle**, making compilation simple with no manual dependency management required. If you prefer, pre-compiled builds are also available on the **[CI Server](https://ci.plex.us.org)**.

## **Prerequisites**

Before compiling, ensure you meet the following requirements:

**Java 21 (JDK 21)** – Plex requires **JDK 21** to compile. Older versions will result in errors.
- If you don’t have Java installed, download it from **[Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/)**.
- During installation, **enable the option to add JDK 21 to your system PATH** (if not selected by default).

**(Optional) Git** – Recommended for cloning the repository and storing build information.
- **Windows users**: Download Git from **[git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)**.
- **macOS/Linux users**: Git is typically pre-installed.

:::note
If you prefer not to use Git, you can manually download the source code as a ZIP from the GitHub page.

## **Compiling Plex**

### **Download the Source Code**
Clone the Plex repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/plexusorg/Plex
```

If you downloaded the source as a ZIP, extract it and navigate to the folder.

### **Navigate to the Project Directory**

```bash
cd Plex
```

### **Run the Build Command**
Plex includes Gradle (no separate installation needed). Run the appropriate command for your OS:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="macOS/Linux" label="macOS/Linux" default>

        ```bash
        ./gradlew build
        ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Windows" label="Windows">

        ```bash
        gradlew.bat build
        ```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### **Locate the Compiled JARs**
After a successful build, the compiled files (`Plex-Server.jar` and `Plex-Proxy.jar`) will be in:

```
build/libs/
```

## **Running Plex**

- **Java 21 is required** on your server to run Plex.
- For best results, use a **Vault-compatible permissions plugin**.
- Check **[Versions](/docs/versions)** for compatibility details.

---

## **Troubleshooting**

##### **Permission Denied (macOS/Linux)**
If you encounter a `Permission denied` error, run:

```bash
chmod a+x gradlew
```

This grants execution permissions to the Gradle wrapper.
