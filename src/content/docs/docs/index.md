Plex is a next-generation freedom server plugin designed to deliver unparalleled flexibility, performance, and
customization. As a modern alternative to [TotalFreedomMod](https://github.com/TotalFreedom/TotalFreedomMod), Plex
retains the core features that define a true freedom server while introducing powerful new enhancements that set it
apart.

We built Plex from the ground up to offer a seamless, high-performance experience with a focus on customization and
scalability. Whether you're running a small community or a large-scale freedom server, Plex gives you the tools to
create a unique and dynamic environment that fits your vision.

One of the biggest changes is permission-based freedom. Plex works seamlessly with permission plugins like LuckPerms, so
you can ditch traditional rank systems entirely. This means you get granular control over what each player can do,
making it easy to customize the experience however you want. Performance was also a top priority. We've optimized Plex
for speed and efficiency to reduce lag and keep your server stable. It supports Redis for indefinite bans and either
MariaDB or SQLite for player data storage, so you can scale up as your community grows.

Customization goes beyond just permissions. You can modify nearly every in-game message to match your server's vibe and
tailor the plugin to fit your community's specific needs. The modular system makes it simple to add or remove features,
so your server can be as lightweight or feature-packed as you need it to be.
