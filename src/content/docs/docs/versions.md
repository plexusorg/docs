description: A list of versions compatible with Plex
---

Plex builds against the latest Minecraft version available. A table has been provided below to help you determine which
versions of Plex work with your version of Minecraft. Note that these are only the versions we have officially tested.
Plex may or may not work with versions other than in this table. We only recommend using [Paper](https://papermc.io).
Plex does have experimental support for Folia. The service system for Plex does support Folia, however world generation
does not work. This is due to Folia having no API available to do so. We intend to add full support for Folia once world
generation support has been added to the official API.
